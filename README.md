### CODE BASED PQC USING RANDOM CODE CONVERSIONS
The code-based cryptosystems generally employ Linear Block codes to create quantum resistant cryptographic schemes. Most of them are vulnerable to structural attacks as the properties of the code can be deciphered from the cipher text. In order to avoid this, multiple codes can be used in a cryptographic scheme to provide more randomness thereby increasing the security. The codes belonging to a specific linear code have certain properties with regard to the generator matrix being used. The purpose of this project is to use multiple codes in cryptographic scheme by converting a specific linear code to linear code of an equivalence class by modifying the generator matrix accordingly and using the obtained linear code in the encryption algorithm. By this, the encryption algorithm becomes resistant to structural attacks which is an important kind of attack in PQC.
